ΓÜá Warning: Next.js inferred your workspace root, but it may not be correct.
 We detected multiple lockfiles and selected the directory of C:\Omniverse\Projects\NeuraLens\bun.lock as the root directory.
 To silence this warning, set `turbopack.root` in your Next.js config, or consider removing one of the lockfiles if it's not needed.
   See https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/turbopack#root-directory for more information.

The export Waveform was not found in module [project]/frontend/node_modules/lucide-react/dist/esm/lucide-react.js [app-client] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import Waves?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
