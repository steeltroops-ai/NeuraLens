## Core Innovation Framework

### **The Neuro-Risk Index (NRI)**

A unified 0-100 score combining:

```
NRI = w1Ã—Speech_Score + w2Ã—Retinal_Score + w3Ã—Risk_Score + w4Ã—Motor_Score
```

**Clinical Significance:**

- **0-25**: Low risk, routine monitoring
- **26-50**: Moderate risk, annual screening
- **51-75**: High risk, specialist referral
- **76-100**: Critical risk, immediate intervention

### **Multi-Modal Assessment Pipeline**

#### **1. Speech Analysis Module**

- **Voice Biomarkers**: Tremor, pause patterns, articulation clarity
- **Cognitive Markers**: Word-finding difficulty, semantic fluency
- **Technology**: Wav2Vec2 embeddings + XGBoost classification
- **Output**: Speech dysfunction probability + confidence intervals

#### **2. Retinal Imaging Module**

- **Vascular Analysis**: Vessel tortuosity, arteriovenous ratio
- **Structural Assessment**: Cup-to-disc ratio, hemorrhage detection
- **Technology**: CNN-based classification + vessel segmentation
- **Output**: Retinal pathology risk + anatomical measurements

#### **3. Risk Factor Assessment**

- **Demographics**: Age, gender, family history
- **Lifestyle**: Exercise, diet, smoking, alcohol
- **Medical History**: Hypertension, diabetes, previous strokes
- **Technology**: Enhanced Framingham Risk Score + ML augmentation
- **Output**: Baseline risk probability + modifiable factor analysis

#### **4. Motor Assessment Module**

- **Tremor Detection**: Smartphone accelerometer analysis
- **Fine Motor Skills**: Typing pattern analysis, drawing tests
- **Gait Analysis**: Camera-based movement assessment
- **Technology**: Signal processing + pattern recognition
- **Output**: Motor dysfunction indicators + progression tracking
