# NeuroLens-X: 50-Hour Development Timeline

## 🚨 **CRITICAL REALITY CHECK - AUGUST 22, 2025**

### **Current Implementation Status**

- ❌ **ML Models**: Interface definitions only, no working implementations
- ❌ **Backend APIs**: Only 1 of 6 endpoints exists (speech.py only)
- ❌ **Demo Data**: No test data available for judges
- ⚠️ **Frontend**: Components exist but may not connect to backend
- ❌ **PWA**: Documented but not implemented
- ❌ **Validation**: No clinical validation metrics

### **Immediate Priority Shift Required**

**Original Plan**: Polish and advanced features
**New Reality**: Focus on basic functionality first
**Success Probability**: 85-90% if we execute P0 features correctly
