```
"Every 40 seconds, someone develops dementia. By the time symptoms
appear, 60% of brain function is already lost. Current screening
methods detect neurological decline only after irreversible damage.

What if we could detect these changes 5-10 years earlier, when
intervention can still make a difference?"
```

#### **Minute 2: Solution Demo (Technical Wow)**

```
[Live demonstration on judge's device]
"NeuroLens-X provides early neurological risk screening through
multi-modal AI analysis. Watch this live assessment:

[Upload audio] → Speech pattern analysis complete
[Upload retinal image] → Vascular pattern analysis complete
[Input demographics] → Risk factor calculation complete

Result: NRI Score 78/100 - High Risk, Specialist Referral Recommended"
```

#### **Minute 3: Technical Excellence (Innovation)**

```
"NeuroLens-X combines four breakthrough technologies:

1. MULTI-MODAL FUSION: Speech + Retinal + Risk + Motor assessment
2. REAL-TIME PROCESSING: Sub-100ms inference with uncertainty quantification
3. EDGE COMPUTING: Complete privacy with browser-based processing
4. CLINICAL VALIDATION: Evidence-based approach with calibration metrics"
```

#### **Minute 4: Impact & Scalability (Market Potential)**

```
"We're addressing the $800B neurological disorder market:
- Early detection saves $50K per patient through prevention
- Deployable in 50,000+ primary care clinics immediately
- Integration-ready with existing healthcare systems
- Scalable to population-level screening programs

This isn't just a hackathon project - it's the future of
