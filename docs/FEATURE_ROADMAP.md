# NeuroLens-X: Feature Development Roadmap

## ðŸŽ¯ **DEVELOPMENT PHILOSOPHY**

**One Feature at a Time**: Each feature is developed, tested, and validated independently before moving to the next. This ensures quality, maintainability, and allows for iterative improvement based on user feedback.

**Clinical Validation First**: Every feature must demonstrate clinical relevance and validation before deployment.

**User-Centered Design**: Features are prioritized based on user needs and clinical impact.
